# BLE Beacon-Based Proximity Detection for Enhanced Museum Experiences

## Getting Started

- The traditional museum experience can be limited and passive,leading to a disconnection from cultural artifacts and art on display.
- The proposal system uses BLE beacons and IoT to create a smart museum experience for visitors.
- BLE beacons are used to trigger notifications and provide relevant information about exhibits based on the visitor’s location and proximity.
- A mobile application running in the background allows vistors to receive notifications without actively sekking out information,enhancing their experience.
- The use of technology creates a dynamic and engaging atmosphere that enhances visitors understading and appreciation of the museum’s collections.

## Objective

- Providing visitors with a personalized and interactive experience that enhances their understanding and appreciation of the exhibits.
- Offering real-time information about the exhibits, such as historical background, cultural significance, and other interesting facts.
- Enabling visitors to explore the museum at their own pace and according to their interests.
- Reducing the need for physical signage and paper guides, which can be costly and difficult to maintain.
- Providing an accessible experience for visitors with disabilities or special needs.
- Improving museum operations by collecting data on visitor behavior and preferences, which can help museums better understand their audience and improve their exhibitions.
